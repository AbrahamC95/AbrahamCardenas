		<div>Hello, I'm Abraham- tech enthusiast, proud member of the Air Force Reserve, and Computer Engineering Technology major at University of Houston.</div>
		<br>
		<p>Right now I am involved in the dynamic that goes into moving originating and in-transit cargo and personnel from one military installation to another. I joined the Air Force in order to serve the country that has provided me so much opportunity. Being in the Air Force, I have learned the importance of having discipline, character, efficient time management, and stress management and how they impact my life. These aspects of our personalities are the primary focus of the Air Force, and learning them has impacted my life significantly in a positive way. Along with being in the Air Force, I also work on programming projects in my free time.</p><p>I am constantly working on projects at home in order to have a deeper understanding of circuits, programming, and design. I have always said that I am heavily interested in the hardware aspect of technology, which is why I chose to be a Computer Engineer Technology major. I love to learn about how circuits are designed and how they are used in our everyday life. I can't use a computer without checking what how much RAM is installed and what kind of processor is being used. I am very anxious to put my knowledge and skill to the test in the real world and learn from experts and experienced tech enthusiasts.</p>
