		<div>Hello, I'm Abraham - tech enthusiast, proud member of the Air Force Reserve, and Computer Engineering Technology major at University of Houston.</div>
		<br>
			<p>I joined the Air Force in order to serve the country that has provided me so much opportunity. Being in the Air Force, I have learned the importance of having discipline, character, efficient time management, and stress management and how they impact my life. These aspects of our personalities are the primary focus of the Air Force, and learning them has impacted my life significantly in a positive way. Along with being in the Air Force, I also work on programming projects in my free time.</p><p>My projects at home usually keep me pretty busy. They range from website building to designing mechanical keyboards and creating them from scratch. I have always said that my interest in technology lies heavily in the hardware side, which is why I chose to be a Computer Engineer Technology major. I love to learn about how circuits are designed and how they are used in our everyday life. I can't use a computer without checking how much RAM is installed and what kind of processor is being used. I am very anxious to put my knowledge and skill to the test in the real world and learn from experts and experienced tech enthusiasts.</p><p>I was born and raised in Houston, so I like to take advantage of everything that the city has to offer. When I'm not at my desk hammering out projects, you can find me at the art museums close to downtown, chasing interesting food trucks all around, and catching fish at the beach in Galveston. My hobbies pretty much take me everywhere.</p>
