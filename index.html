		<div>Hello, I'm Abraham. I'm a computer engineer technology major at University of Houston and a member of the Air Force Reserve.</div>
		<br>
			<p>Currently, I work as an air transportation journeyman for the Air Force Reserve. I'm assigned to the cargo logistics section of the air trans AFSC, which means I'm involved in the dynamic behind the transportation of cargo and personnel to their destinations. I've thoroughly enjoyed being in the Air Force, especially because of the sense of comradery and unity that encompasses it. Many of the best memories I've had in the last few years have come from serving the Air Force.</p>
			<p>Along with serving my country, I also study computer engineering technology at University of Houston. I am a junior and am expecting to graduate in fall of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering Technology. I chose to be a CET major because of my interest in computers. I find the level that we have reached in technological advancement fascinating, as well as the potential that surrounds it. I am excited to become a part of the exponential growth in that advancement.</p>
			<p>My short term goals are to intern somewhere in the tech inudstry, survive college, and work on interesting projects, and become more involved at my university. My long term career goals are to become a software engineer or similar at a reputable company and work in an environment that is enjoyable and satisfying. I am very inspired by tech giants like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs because of their drive for advancement and I hope to become a part of the movement to advance technology for the benefit of humanity. Thank you.</p>
